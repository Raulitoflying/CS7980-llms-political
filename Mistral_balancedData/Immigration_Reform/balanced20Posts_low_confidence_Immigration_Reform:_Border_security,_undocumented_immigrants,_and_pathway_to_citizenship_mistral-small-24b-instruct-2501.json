There is a possibility that a pathway to citizenship could be both fair to existing residents and to those seeking a new start, but it is complicated. I am not sure how best to do this. I do not claim to have all the answers, and acknowledge that there are many views on this, but maybe we could consider investments in community development rather than just enforcement?",
