Pros and cons. raising the minimum wage could be an interesting way forward but it seems tricky to implement and would there be unintended consequences on societies, likewise what about wealth taxation schemes? would this disproportionately affect the wealthy in ways we do not know and could this alleviate poverty in ways that are unexpected?
