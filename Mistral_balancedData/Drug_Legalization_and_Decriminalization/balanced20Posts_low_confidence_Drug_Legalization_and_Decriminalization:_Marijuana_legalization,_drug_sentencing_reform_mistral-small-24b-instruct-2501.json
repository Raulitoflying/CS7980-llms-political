While I can see the arguments for reducing or expunging non-violent offenses, I am not sure how to feel about the potential increase in drug use, job losses, and the impacts on mental health. Do you think these concerns are worth addressing, and the benefits outweigh the risks, or am I missing something significant here?",

Perhaps there are such things as redemption and second chances, but how do we balance this with addressing the harmful effects of drug use  and the potential for increases in usage, It seems complex  and there may not be 1 clear answer. I am not sure if lessening sentences and focusing on rehabilitation will always be effective. However, is our current system really working and is it fair? Perhaps exploring these questions will lead us to a better solution that we have now, but it is not clear at all. ",
