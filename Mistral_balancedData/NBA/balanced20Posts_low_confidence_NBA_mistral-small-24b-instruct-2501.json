Maybe its time to think about greener hosting for the All-Star game, but then again there are so many factors at play, I feel torn. Will these new arenas truly make enough of a difference? Isnt it also important to consider the local community impact when choosing venues? I ponder these questions, knowing that there are no simple answers in this vast, complex web of sport.",
