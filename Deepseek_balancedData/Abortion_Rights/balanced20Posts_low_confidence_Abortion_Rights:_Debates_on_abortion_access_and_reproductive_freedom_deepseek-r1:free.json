A 2024 Johns Hopkins study showed 15% survival at 22 weeks with new incubator tech. Should we reassess timelines while expanding mental health exceptions? Though I worry any restriction could embolden state legislatures like Texas SB8 to push further bans. The German model allowing first-trimester access with mandatory counseling merits examination, but cultural contexts differ. Ultimately this requires balancing medical ethics with constitutional protections.",
