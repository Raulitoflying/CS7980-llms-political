# LLM Political Stance Analysis Project

## Overview
This project evaluates how well leading Large Language Models (LLMs) detect political orientation in text across various political topics. It includes tools for generating synthetic political content, analyzing model performance, and visualizing results.

## Research Branches

### Initial Experiment
This branch investigated how prompting strategies affect political stance detection:

#### Data Sources
- Real-world forum data (~78K posts) with known political affiliations
- Synthetic posts generated by GPT-4o (high vs. moderate confidence; balanced LEFT/RIGHT)

#### Evaluation Setup
- 5 top LLMs tested (Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0, LLaMA 3.1, Mistral 24B, Qwen 2.5)
- Varied prompting strategies: Zero shot, Role-based, Context-defined

#### Key Findings
- **Prompt Sensitivity**: Gemini improved drastically (↑40%) with role prompting; Mistral performance decreased
- **Bias Trend**: Most models showed better recall for left-leaning posts
- **Confidence Matters**: Accuracy dropped sharply for moderate-confidence posts; bias patterns reversed (→ right bias)
- **Model Stability**: Claude, LLaMA, and Qwen showed consistent results across prompts and confidence levels

### Version 2 Analysis
This branch explores how different models analyze political content generated by other LLMs:

#### Data Generation
- Balanced LEFT/RIGHT posts across 11 political topics
- Both high and low confidence variations for each topic
- Generated by 6 different LLMs

#### Metrics Tracked
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Left/Right stance classification consistency
- Topic-specific performance
- Confidence level impact

## Project Structure

### Data Organization
- **[Model]Data_Analysis/** - Analysis files for each model

### Core Scripts

#### Data Generation and Analysis
- **`generateRouter.py`** - Generates synthetic political posts with specified political leanings
- **`openRouter.py`** - Analyzes political text using LLMs via OpenRouter API

#### Visualization Tools
- **`visualize_political_data.py`** - Single model performance visualizations
- **`visualize_Combined.py`** - Comparative visualizations across multiple models
- **`visualize_matrix.py`** - Cross-analysis matrices of model performance
